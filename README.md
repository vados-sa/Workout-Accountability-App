# 🏋️ MotivateMates: Workout Tracking App
The idea for this app came from a friend who, while training for [Hyrox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHAs8F9Cek), wanted an easy way to stay accountable with his race partner. Since I’m also preparing for Hyrox, I saw this as a great learning opportunity and offered to build the app myself.

While there are plenty of workout tracking apps out there, this project is all about learning valuable development skills and creating something fit for our needs. Plus, by the end of it, we’ll have our own little app that’s simple, effective, and built from scratch!

## 🎯 App Goals:
Simple Interface: Log your workouts with ease.

Shared Calendar: See your own and your friends' workouts for the week.

Core Features:
- Sign Up / Log In: Secure authentication for each user.
- Welcome Page: A friendly introduction to the app.
- Home Page: Log your weekly workouts.
- Calendar Page: Track activities alongside your friends.
- Settings Page: Manage your account, including the option to delete it.

The goal is to keep things simple—no fancy features (for now), just what’s necessary to stay motivated and accountable.

## 🚧 Work in Progress
I’m still in the process of developing the app, but as soon as it’s up and running, you’re more than welcome to try it out!          
### Early prototypes:
Simple ideas for which functionalities the app should have, its design will most likely change.
